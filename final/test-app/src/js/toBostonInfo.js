To get a taxi, simply follow signs to ground transportation. Rush hour traffic can add a significant amount of time to your trip so plan accordingly. Public transportation to and from Logan is an affordable alternative to a taxi and a great way to avoid traffic. Look up the MBTA stop closest to your destination to determine which bus to take. The Silver Line connects with the Red Line and Commuter Rail at South Station while the Blue Line connects to the Green Line, Orange Line, and Commuter Rail at North Station. It's free to ride the Silver line when inbound from the airport, but keep in mind that you'll need to pay the fare when returning to the airport."
