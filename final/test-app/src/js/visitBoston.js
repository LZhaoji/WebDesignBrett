        title: 'Boston Public Transportation',
        para: "The MBTA is Boston’s public transportation system, and it’s a great way to get around quickly and cheaply. The “T” refers to the subway, which runs throughout Boston, into Cambridge, and into nearby suburbs, providing access to all the attractions located in Boston. Just look for the big `T` in a circle to find a stop. You can also take buses to get all over the city, and the Commuter Rail is an easy way to get to points outside of Boston. You can buy paper “Charlie Tickets” for single or multiple subway rides at vending machines located in most stations. When your ticket runs low, visit a fare vending machine to add value. A single basic fare for the T is $2.75 with a Charlie Ticket, although if you pick up a Charlie Card (a plastic card like a credit card), the fare is lower at $2.25 for one way. You can load the Charlie Card with an amount of your choosing, so it's the smart way to explore the city. They're available at almost every T stop and are free to get. Once on board, hang on! Being one of the oldest public transportation systems in the country, the T is not always the smoothest ride."

        para: "You’ll be amazed at how small the city really is — you could walk across the heart of Boston in about an hour! It’s worth taking a stroll along the Charles River Esplanade or across the river to Cambridge, where you're rewarded with amazing views of the city skyline. Explore the city by neighborhood and you’ll find that many attractions are in close proximity to one another and easily walkable. Consider renting a bike for the day for a fun and memorable way to get around the city and experience the enthusiastic Boston biking culture."

        title: 'Taxis & Ride Share',
        para: "Taxis are widely available, easy to flag down, and a great option for getting around the city after the T’s operating hours. Popular ride-sharing services are available in Boston as an alternative to taxis as well, with services like Lyft and Uber easy to use and access. Keep in mind that you will need to download the app of your chosen service in advance, so do some research before your trip."

        title: 'Parking',
        para: "Depending on where and when you’re looking to park in Boston, securing a spot can be difficult. Most street parking downtown is metered with time limits and restrictions are strictly enforced. Parking garages are easy to find, but can be pricey. If you park in a garage, check to see if it offers validated parking (for example, guests of a hotel or nearby attraction)."

        title: 'Other Options',
        para: "You can also take a Hop On/Hop Off Trolley Tour to see the sites at your own pace. Your Go Boston pass entitles you to a two day ticket, meaning that you can enjoy fully-narrated luxury rides around the hottest Boston spots for a full 48 hours. As well as exploring the city by bus, why not make the chore of moving about the city more exciting with a 2-in-1 Duck Tour trip combining a guided bus and boat tour of the city. These fabulous aquatic buses will pick you up on dry land in a World War II-style landing craft, that will then cruise past Trinity Church, Faneuil Hall, and the Holocaust Memorial. Then, just when you think you've seen it all, your tour bus will transform into a boat, and you'll glide right into the Charles River to get a duck's-eye view of Cambridge and Boston."
