        para: "A doughy roll isn’t the only carb that goes well with lobster. There’s nothing quite as indulgent as a gooey, cheesy, hearty bowl of lobster-stuffed mac and cheese. Most of the restaurants (and there are many) that serve lobster rolls also serve their version of lobster mac, but everyone makes theirs differently.Amongst the many desirable Boston foods on the menu at Yankee Lobster is possibly the best lobster mac in town. The macaroni is made with a white cheddar and Parmesan base, mixed with bursting roasted tomatoes, and of course, lots of chunky lobster pieces. The whole thing is topped with crunchy breadcrumbs for a golden, mouthwatering finish."

        para: "You don’t have to know much about Boston or clams or chowder to know that clam chowder (properly pronounced chowdah) is one of the most notorious Boston foods. While it’s considered a New England food, Boston is where it’s best. Since the dish is so popular, thanks to the abundance of fresh, succulent clams in the surrounding waters, there are many, many restaurants that serve up a perfectly good bowl of clam chowder. As such, narrowing down one chowder as the crowning chowder is difficult, but Union Oyster House’s version tends to make it into everyone’s top choices. It’s been around since the 1850s, so clearly, these chefs know what they’re doing.Union Oyster House doles out steaming bowls of clam chowder the classic way – lumps of juicy, fresh clam swimming in a creamy, salty broth.

        para: "You can’t go to Beantown without trying baked beans somewhere in town.Boston baked beans date back to colonial times, and they’ve stuck around long enough to have made an indelible mark in Bostonian culture. We’re not saying baked beans are Boston’s most gourmet, to-die-for cuisines, but it’s one of those Boston foods that is comforting, traditional and never really bad.Also, you can get them pretty much anywhere in the city. But where better to get baked beans than at the Beantown Pub itself? Here, expect a heaping portion of sweet baked beans served with a rustic side of brown bread."

        para: "In addition to clams and lobsters, Boston is also in an opportune location for harvesting fresh oysters. As with lobster and clams, there are lots of local restaurants serving up these indulgent shellfish. However, Union Oyster House, one of the oldest restaurants in Boston, has been serving happy customers freshly shucked oysters for almost 200 years, and they’re just how they should be: plump with plenty of that salty, beloved oyster juice."
